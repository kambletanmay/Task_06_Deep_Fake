## Script

### Introduction

**Interviewer:** I'm here backstage at the Dong'an Lake Sports Park in Chengdu with the Worlds 2025 Finals MVP—T1's Gumayusi. Congratulations on the incredible victory! How does it feel right now?

### Main Content

**Gumayusi:** Thank you so much. Honestly, I still can't believe it. We just made history—the first team ever to win three World Championships in a row. It's surreal. I've dreamed about this moment for so long, and to actually achieve it with this team, with these players... I'm just overwhelmed with emotion right now.

---

**Interviewer:** You received the MVP award from Uzi himself, a Hall of Legends inductee. That must have been a special moment.

**Gumayusi:** Receiving the award from Uzi was incredible. He's a legend, someone I looked up to when I was just starting to play AD Carry. For him to hand me this trophy... it validated everything I've worked for. It felt like passing the torch, you know?

---

**Interviewer:** The series against KT Rolster was incredibly close—you were down 2-1 at one point. What was going through your mind during those critical moments?

**Gumayusi:** When we lost game two and then game three, I won't lie—there was pressure. KT played amazingly. Bdd was incredible on Mel, and deokdam was playing out of his mind. But we've been in tough situations before. We looked at each other in the booth, and we just knew—we weren't going to let it end like this. Faker said something to us... he said, "We've been here before. Trust yourselves." And that's what we did.

---

**Interviewer:** You mentioned earlier this year that you always felt like you had to prove yourself. Do you feel like you've finally done that?

**Gumayusi:** *pauses* This year was very difficult for me. Every year has been full of challenges, and I always had to prove myself over and over again. I've been the icon of someone who always has to prove himself. But this year was different. Finally, I feel like I have proven myself—not just to others, but to myself. And I can say for sure now: I am the best AD Carry in the world.

**Interviewer:** The Telecom War rivalry with KT Rolster has been going on for over 13 years. How special is it to defeat them in a World Championship Final?

**Gumayusi:** The Telecom War is legendary. Every Korean League fan knows about this rivalry. To face KT in the World Finals—our biggest rival, a team that wanted to beat us so badly, especially Score and their whole organization—and to come out on top... it adds another chapter to this historic rivalry. I have so much respect for KT. They pushed us to our absolute limits. Peter, deokdam, Bdd, Cuzz, Duro—they're all incredible players. But in the end, T1 found a way to win, like we always do.

---

**Interviewer:** What's next for you and T1 after this historic achievement?

**Gumayusi:** *laughs* Right now? I just want to celebrate with my teammates. We've been grinding so hard all year—especially after our rocky start in the Swiss Stage. We went 3-2 and barely made it out. But playoffs Faker activated, playoffs T1 activated. As for what's next... we'll think about that later. Tonight, we celebrate. We're three-time back-to-back-to-back World Champions. Let that sink in.

### Closing

**Interviewer:** One final question—any message for the fans who supported you through this incredible journey?

**Gumayusi:** To all the T1 fans around the world—thank you. Thank you for believing in us even when things looked rough. The 6.7 million people who watched us today, everyone who cheered for us in the stadium in Chengdu, everyone watching from home... we did this for you. T1 fighting! *raises three fingers* Three-peat, baby!

**Interviewer:** Congratulations once again, Gumayusi. The Worlds 2025 Finals MVP and three-time World Champion. Thank you for your time.

**Gumayusi:** Thank you. T1 forever.
