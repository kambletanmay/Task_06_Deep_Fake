# Task 06: Deep Fake Interview

## Overview

This repository documents my work on Research Task 6, which involves creating an AI-generated "deep fake" interview. The goal is to transform a narrative or script into an audio or video format that simulates a realistic interview scenario.

## Objective

Take a narrative (either from a previous research task or created from scratch) and produce an AI-generated deep fake interview. The ideal output is a video—potentially styled as a "street interview"—though an audio-based interview is an acceptable alternative if video production isn't feasible with free tools.

## What This Project Emphasizes

This task prioritizes **process over product**. The focus is on:

- Documenting the approach and workflow
- Exploring and evaluating different AI tools
- Recording challenges encountered and solutions attempted
- Reflecting on what worked and what didn't

Even incomplete or "unsuccessful" attempts are valuable as long as they are thoroughly documented.

## Tools Explored

This section will be updated as tools are tested.

| Tool | Type | Free Tier? | Notes |
|------|------|------------|-------|
| *TBD* | Video | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| *TBD* | Audio | *TBD* | *TBD* |
| *TBD* | Voice Cloning | *TBD* | *TBD* |

## Workflow

1. **Script Development:** Create or adapt a narrative into an interview format
2. **Tool Research:** Identify free/student-accessible AI tools for audio and video generation
3. **Audio Generation:** Produce AI-generated voice content
4. **Video Generation (if feasible):** Create visual deep fake content
5. **Assembly:** Combine elements into a cohesive interview
6. **Documentation:** Record the entire process, including successes and failures
